# Smash Bros Melee

## Problem
Identify different features of smash bros melee in real time from this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj7IX18ccdY) from Evo 2014. 
- [ ] what stage was picked 
- [ ] when the game starts 
- [ ] player names 
- [ ] how many stocks the player has 
- [ ] how much percent the player is 
- [ ] in-game timer 
- [ ] draw bounding around the players  
- [ ] which character is been played

Just an example of what it is detected in the video. 

I forgot to convert the image to RGB in the gif :)

## Solution 
I divided the problem in two main stages:
- find the location of stuff on the screen (e.g. the timer on the top)
-
